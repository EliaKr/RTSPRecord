# RTSPRecord
A simple RTSP stream recorder that records a stream in segments and supports looping the recording once storage space runs out. Ideal for use in low-powered devices like the Raspberry Pi.

#### Note: Unencrypted RTSP streams can be easily intercepted. If you want to record a device outside of your local network the best solution is a site-to-site VPN.
